# GroupInfoDisplay
Addon replacement for FUNKI's Weakaura Group Info Display.

I found this weakaura (RIP) useful and was immediately missing it in my 
12.0 UI. I decided to rewrite it as an addon to continue its legacy.

## Features
- Group Number
- Raid Composition
- Raid/Dungeon Difficulty
- Current Specialization
- Current Hero Talents
- Current Loadout Name
- Current Loot Specialization
- Last but not least, hideable in combat (or not)

## Usage
/gid font NN - Set font size
/gid reset - Reset settings

Right-click GID display to configure.

Upon logging in the first time after installing GID (or resetting), the GID 
display will appear in the middle of the screen with a background.  You can 
move it around by draggingit with your mouse.  When you have it in the 
location you want, right-clickit and select "Display Lock" on the pop-up menu.  
NOTE: It is only moveablewhen it is unlocked (denoted by the presence of background).

Configurarion is done by right-clicking the GID display, and toggling the 
applicable information in the pop-up menu.
