# GroupInfoDisplay
Addon replacement for FUNKI's Weakaura Group Info Display.

I found this weakaura (RIP) useful and was immediately missing it in my 
12.0 UI. I decided to rewrite it as an addon to continue its legacy.

## Available Information
- Group Number (in raid)
- Raid Composition (in raid)
- Raid/Dungeon Difficulty (in group/raid/instance)
- Current Specialization
- Current Hero Talents
- Current Loadout Name
- Current Loot Specialization

## Usage
- /gid font NN - Set font size
- /gid reset - Reset settings

Right-click the GID display to configure.

Upon logging in the first time after installing GID (or resetting), the GID 
display will appear in the middle of the screen with a background.  You can 
move it around by dragging it with your mouse.  When you have it in the 
location you want, right-click again and select "Display Lock" on the pop-up menu. 
NOTE: It is only moveable when it is unlocked (denoted by the presence of background).

Configuration is done by right-clicking the GID display and toggling the 
applicable information in the pop-up menu.
